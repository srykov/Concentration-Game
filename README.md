# Memory Game Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to build my own version of the classic memory game 'Concentration', using javascript, DOM selectors, and event listeners.  Udacity provided some starter HTML & CSS code to display a static version of the Memeory Game. I wrote the javascript to bring the game's functionality to life, as well as customizing the HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the Web Programming with Javascript course.

Specifically I practiced:
* using DOM selectors
* using event listeners

## Getting Started
To try The Memory Game out:
* Download the source code
* Open index.html in your browser.
* Start playing by clicking any card!

## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
