# Memory Game Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to build my own version of the classic memory game 'Concentration', using javascript, DOM selectors, and event listeners.  Udacity provided some starter HTML & CSS code to display a static version of the Memeory Game. I wrote the javascript to bring the game's functionality to life, as well as customizing the HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the Web Programming with Javascript course.

Specifically I practiced:
* using DOM selectors
* using event listeners

## Getting Started
To try The Memory Game out:
* Download the source code
* Open index.html in your browser.
* Start playing by clicking any card!
